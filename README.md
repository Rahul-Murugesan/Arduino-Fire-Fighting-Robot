# Arduino Fire Fighting Robot with Servo Spray & Buzzer Alert

This project demonstrates an **autonomous fire fighting robot** built using Arduino.  
The robot detects fire using IR flame sensors, moves toward the fire, activates a servo motor to spray water (or extinguisher), and gives buzzer alerts during operation.
